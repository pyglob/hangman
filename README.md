Hangman is a game which a user needs to guess a whole word

The number of blank spaces representing the word is displayed (dashes)

2. Guesses:
    The word guesser takes turns suggesting letters one at a time. 
The word setter indicates if the guessed letter is in the word and its correct positions. 
If the letter is correct, it is filled in the blank spaces. 
If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hanged man is drawn. 
The word guesser can also guess the whole word at any time. 

3. Winning and Losing:
    The word guesser wins if they correctly guess all the letters before the hanged man is completed.
    The word guesser loses if the hanged man is completed before they guess all the letters.
